NEW!

- updated project folder
- Using Framework!
- Using codeigniter framework!
- framework version: 4
- visit codeigniter.com
- uses MVC (model , view , controller)



NOTE:

- all files must be organize based on their functions
- check the database.sql inside the app > database folder and execute the query
- only inside the app folder the team can work on the rest dont touch it!
- dont mess around
- if you update some features make sure to tell me first befor pushing the updates into the main branch or everything will be chaos
- dont change anything inside .env file
- dont remove anything inside the public folder except creating, managing folders or files for css, js, images, videos, sounds, libraries, etc
- you can only modify the database.php, routes.php files inside the config files, the rest of the files inside it DONT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR ADD NEW FILE INSIDE!!
- fuck you julian barbers and paulo contis



advantages of using framework!

- fast development
- easy syntax
- dont need lines of code for a one feature (example: retrieving data from database)



disadvantages of using framework!

- need to learn new systax and logic
- hard at first but its super easy to learn
